(d) When is the Flesch Kincaid score *not* a valid, robust or reliable estimator of text difficulty? Give two conditions. (Text answer, 200 words maximum).
- When the text contains terminology that is not familiar to the reader for example,
medical text might be filled with terms not easily understood by someone without medical knowledge.
- When the text has a short sentence structure, the score might not consider the complexity
of the sentence.
